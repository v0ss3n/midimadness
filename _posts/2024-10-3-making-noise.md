Now that you have soldered your MIDI Madness Maker (and maybe done the software setup too) it's time to test it and make some noise! The microcontroller is pre-programmed with the code example 'MIDI_madness_BLE_keyboard_and_Tone.ino' so it should bleep when you touch the touch pins. If you want the bleeps to be louder, you can plug in a speaker in the audio jack. 

The microcontroller is also programmed as a Bluetooth keyboard, so if you download the following apps to your phone/tablet, and look for the name of your MIDI Madness Maker, you should be able to use it right away!

Android: download SynprezFM II and MIDI BLE Connect
Apple: download Garageband (and Bluetooth MIDI Connect if needed)

If you want a different code example - ask Michelle! All of the code can be installed via her computer during the workshop. After the workshop, you can do it yourself :)
