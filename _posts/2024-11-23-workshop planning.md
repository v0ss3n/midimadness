## Workshop planning

| 11:00-11:45 | Introduction, program and the concepts of the day, examples. Demo of soldering, explanation of MIDI Madness website |
| 11:45-13:00 | One starts with soldering the MIDI Madness Maker, making connectors and testing with pre-uploaded code. The other starts with e-textile sensor crafting, testing with the existing MIDI Madness set-up if needed |
| 13:00-13:30 | Testing all of the MIDI Madness boards, and deciding in groups what kind of textile instrument you want to make: wearable, modular, stand-alone. Then work on the e-textiles together. Don't forget to think about the connection between the MIDI Madness Maker and the textile sensors - hard-soft connections can also be designed! |
| 13:30-14:00 | Lunch break |
| 14:00-15:00 | Make your own e-textile MIDI keyboard/interface! If you want, it's possible to change the MIDI notes that you're sending (or play around with the code if you know your way around the Arduino IDE) |
| 15:00-15:15 | MIDI Madness jam! |
| 15:15-15:30 | Clean up & wrap up | 

<!-- Day 1 - Friday April 4. Today we focus on soldering the electronics and getting started with e-textiles.

<!-- introduction:
- mini presentation
- examples > repository and midi madness maker with various sound outputs
- MIDI Madness Maker kit > participants should also make clip cables with network cables and alligators/safety pins/clips
- Website with code examples & getting started


day 2 programming
- testing if we can connect and upload to the ESP32, explain drivers boards etc
- input: touchRead, analogRead with e-textile sensor made the day before
- output: speaker Tone
- communication: MIDI, bluetooth
